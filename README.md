# TkCalculator

So, I've created a calculator using tkinter!
It isn't very multitasking, but there is that you usually have to calculate:
Operations: +-x/^!√ and a π number.
It's so cool that it can execute strings like this: 8+2x9-4/6!+√9^4+π/2 and even harder!

P.S. Of course, there are a few bugs that I was too lazy to fix like: 2^4^3=4096 (he sees it like (2^4)^3=16^3)
